Opal does not play well with Angular.js. See https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/259 and  https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/400 for details.

This can be fixed by doing a global find and replace on the $ character with opal$ in opal.js and asciidoctor.js. Some manual clean up then needs to be
done to pick up cases where the $ sign was used as part of a regex.

In opal.js you have lines like:
if ((opal$a = name['opal$=~'](/^[A-Z]\w*$/)) === false || opal$a === nil) {

In asciidoctor.js you have lines line:
opal$opal.cdecl(opal$scope, 'PassInlineMacroRx', /\\?(?:(\+{3}|opal\${2})(.*?)\1|pass:([a-z,]*)\[(.*?[^\\])\])/i);

and regexes at the bottom of the file starting with AuthorInfoLineRx

Also need to change calls to opal$round() to just Math.round()
